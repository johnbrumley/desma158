[Proteus](https://twistedtree.itch.io/proteus): Procedurally generated island and soundscape

Create a game that can run independent of player input. Use randomness, simulation, and generative techniques to introduce unpredictability. Consider timescale, the audience/spectator, and who or what might interact with the system. Optionally, the game can also be influenced via external input from a player or environment.

You may choose to make a generative landscape, a music/sound machine, a random character generator, a program that creates different buildings with modular parts, a simulation of creatures or natural systems, an abstract art generator, procedurally generated stories, or anything else that you can imagine.

When building your game, especially one that involves generative objects, sounds, paintings, animals, worlds, etc., consider the 10,000 bowls of oatmeal problem, described by Kate Compton:

> So your algorithm may generate 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets. They may each be subtly different, but as they player is exploring them rapidly, will they be _perceived as different_? I like to call this problem the **10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal** problem. I can easily generate 10,000 bowls of plain oatmeal, with each oat being in a different position and different orientation, and _mathematically speaking_ they will all be completely unique. But the user will likely just see _a lot of oatmeal_. **Perceptual uniqueness** is the real metric, and it’s darn tough.

# Deliverables

- **Automatic.** The game should run/proceed/progress on it's own, meaning that things should happen even if nobody is around to press any buttons.
- **Non-deterministic**. The game should not run the same way twice. The output and combinations should be varied enough that repetition is rare. How much time should be spent with the work?
- **Consideration of inputs**. A player doesn’t need to interact directly with the work, but consider the player/spectator and how they should view the work. Is it meant to be meditative, overwhelming, funny? Should it run ambiently in the background, should it run on extended cycles (hours, days, seasons, lifetimes, every rainy day, etc.), should it use external sensors or react to network data?
- **2D, 3D, XD**. No restrictions on the format.

# 1. Sketches of ideas
**Due by Tuesday 11/14**

Develop a short document that outlines your game. What are you creating and how will it run? How do you imagine someone viewing or interacting with it? Does the work live somewhere beyond a screen or projection? Mock up a few examples of what you want to create.
### Be sure to include:
1. Possible titles
2. What is being created, explored, revealed, etc. Is there a story behind the process? 
3. How should a person view or interact with the game? Is there a form of input or external influence that affects the game?
4. Drawings. Sketch what your work might look like at key moments. Consider the extremes of what might be generated. This should reflect the scope of what might be possible in your project. It might be useful to refer back to [Kate Compton’s “So you want to build a generator…”](https://galaxykate0.tumblr.com/post/139774965871/so-you-want-to-build-a-generator) and consider the properties, constraints, and methods you'll be using.

# 2. Prototype it
**Show in class on Tuesday 11/28**

Start by building a graybox prototype of your randomized system. Grayboxing is a level design practice where you build a rough block-out version of your level using blocks (usually gray boxes) so that you can iterate and test the layout as soon as possible.

Build as much of your game as you can while focusing on solely the mechanics, systems, and behaviors. Use built-in Unity assets or placeholders for any art elements (graphics, sounds, text). You’ll be able to focus on art, writing, sound, and other game polish in the third part of the assignment.

We will share prototypes in class. It is important to have a working (or partially working) prototype so we can give feedback and support.

# 3. Build it
**Due by Thursday 12/7**

[Submit Project 3: Automatic Game](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgE0gt8wHVE837ue1QGkSMilJHnCjrLHA9wEd977R89pW7Fg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

1. Build your game. It should be able to run on it's own.
2. If you have an alternative outputs or inputs (custom controllers/sensors, external data, prints, artifacts, etc.) Please include documentation in the screen shots.
3. Document the context of the game, that is, how should it be viewed. As a website, downloaded and run on a laptop/desktop (full screen or windowed), projected on a wall, sound only, or some other context.

Please refer to the page on [preparing your game for submission](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more information on the build and documentation process.
