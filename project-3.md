# Game as Engine

What is a game engine? Project 3 is about considering the potential for games, systems, and other digital objects to act as generative engines for ideas, experiences, arguments, perspectives, subversions, meditations, and everything in between.

So far in this class, you've been learning to build projects using the Unity game engine. For this project, you will explore both Unity and other forms of game engines to build a meta-game, that is, something which is aware of games, sampling from or even built upon existing games, but also consciously outside of its referent. 

> Prepositions are to parts of speech as _metagames_ are to games. A signifier for everything occurring before, after, between, and during games as well as everything located in, on, around, and beyond games, the metagame anchors the game in time and space.

There are lots of options for what you can make, and we'll cover a few possibilities in class (simulation, music, alternative inputs, sampling other games). But there are many more techniques than we can cover in class, especially when it comes to modding or hacking a specific media source.

## Feeling stuck? 
Here is one option based around simulation:

Create a game that can run independent of player input. Use randomness, simulation, and generative techniques to introduce unpredictability. Consider timescale, progression, the audience/spectator, and who or what might interact with the system. Optionally, the game can be influenced, but only minimally, via external input from a player or environmental sensors.

You might choose to make a generative landscape, a music/sound machine, a random character generator, a program that creates different buildings with modular parts, a simulation of creatures or natural systems, an abstract art generator, procedurally generated stories, or anything else that you can imagine.

When building your game, especially one that involves generative objects, sounds, paintings, animals, worlds, etc., consider the 10,000 bowls of oatmeal problem, described by Kate Compton:

> So your algorithm may generate 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets. They may each be subtly different, but as they player is exploring them rapidly, will they be _perceived as different_? I like to call this problem the **10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal** problem. I can easily generate 10,000 bowls of plain oatmeal, with each oat being in a different position and different orientation, and _mathematically speaking_ they will all be completely unique. But the user will likely just see _a lot of oatmeal_. **Perceptual uniqueness** is the real metric, and it’s darn tough.

# Deliverables

- **Consideration of engine.** What runs the game and how does the game relate to the things "in, around, and beyond" it?
- **Consideration of inputs**. Does a player need to interact directly with the work? Consider the player/spectator and how they should view the work. Is it meant to be meditative, overwhelming, funny? Should it run ambiently in the background, should it run on extended cycles (hours, days, seasons, lifetimes, every rainy day, etc.), should it use external sensors or react to network data?
- **2D, 3D, XD**. No restrictions on the format.

# 1. Sketches of ideas
**Due by Tuesday 11/14**

Develop a short sketch that outlines your game. What are you creating and how will it run? How do you imagine someone viewing or interacting with it? Does the work live somewhere beyond a screen or projection? Mock up a few examples of what you want to create.
### Be sure to include:
1. Possible titles
2. What is the Engine?
3. What is being created, explored, revealed, etc. Is there a story behind the process? 
4. How should a person view or interact with the game? Is there a form of input or external influence that affects the game?
5. Drawings. Sketch what your work might look like at key moments. Does it involve other games? Reflect the scope of what might be possible in your project.

# 2. Prototype
**Show in class on Tuesday 11/28**

Build as much of your game as you can while focusing on solely the mechanics, systems, and behaviors. Try and mock up individual components of the system. If using custom inputs, show how they will work. It's ok to use placeholders for any art elements (graphics, sounds, text). 

We will share prototypes in class. It is important to have a working (or partially working) prototype so we can give feedback and support.

# 3. Build it
**Due by Thursday 12/7**

[Submit Project 3: Automatic Game](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgE0gt8wHVE837ue1QGkSMilJHnCjrLHA9wEd977R89pW7Fg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

1. Build your game. It should be able to run on it's own.
2. If you have an alternative outputs or inputs (custom controllers/sensors, external data, prints, artifacts, etc.) Please include documentation in the screen shots.
3. Document the context of the game, that is, how should it be viewed. As a website, downloaded and run on a laptop/desktop (full screen or windowed), projected on a wall, sound only, or some other context.

Please refer to the page on [preparing your game for submission](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more information on the build and documentation process.
