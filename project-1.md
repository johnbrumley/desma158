Create a 3D game that uses keyboard controls to maneuver a physics-based sphere through space and gather collectables. This simple game serves as an introduction to development with Unity.

## 1. Complete Roll-a-ball

**Due by Thursday 4/6**

This project will build off the official Unity [Roll-a-ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball), so the first step is to complete the entire tutorial and have a fully set up project ready for part 2. Everyone needs to complete this project as soon as you can!

## 2. Design a better version

**Due by Tuesday 4/11**

Roll-A-Ball as it is, is not much of a “game” – you can win by collecting the pickups but you can’t really lose, there is no challenge designed into the game, and the outcome is predictable – so we want to fix all of this and make Roll-A-Ball into a good game using level design and adding a bit of risk!

Create a short design document illustrating an idea of how to make Roll-a-ball into a good game. Additionally create an overlay image that will function as a “title card” overlay that appears when the game loads.

1. PDF with a paragraph containing these elements:  
    – How do you win this game?  
    – How do you lose this game?  
    – A detailed sketch or an illustration of your level design / map!  
    – Describe (for the player to read) – what is the central challenge of this game?  
    – Come up with a title for your game
2. Overlay image (PNG) and text explaining how to play your game. This overlay will be visible when your game starts and can be toggled on and off.

## 3. Build it

**Due by Tuesday 4/18**

1. Use any 3D assets you want to build a more interesting and playable game level – these assets could be made up of Unity Prefabs, your own 3D models, flat image cutouts, etc.
2. Add in the missing game mechanics that will challenge the player and create one or more lose conditions (for example: traps that reset the game if you touch them, falling off the world, pickups that hurt you, a life bar that depletes over time, a time limit, moving gates that push you back, becoming utterly, irrevocably lost, making poor fiscal decisions, spotted by a cat….). Game should be able to restart when Win / Lose happens.
3. Create a title overlay using 2D assets (Images, fonts, etc. from step 2 !😉) that has instructions for your game – this overlay should be visible when your game starts and should be able to be shown and hidden during the game by pressing the ‘q’ key.
4. Add sound to your game! Make a looping background track, sound effects for pickups, sound effects for other events, narration.

Please refer to the page on [preparing your game for submission](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more information on the build and documentation process.
