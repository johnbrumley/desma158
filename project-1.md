Create a remix of the Roll-a-ball tutorial game that explores the possibilities of spatial narrative and expands the scope of the original. The Roll-a-ball tutorial serves as a quick tour of the Unity Editor, while also providing a foundation for creating something more expansive.

## 1. Complete Roll-a-ball

**Due by Tuesday 10/3**

This project will build off the official Unity [Roll-a-ball tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball), so the first step is to complete the entire tutorial and have a fully set up project ready for part 2. Everyone needs to complete this project!

## 2. Beyond Roll-a-ball

**Due by Thursday 10/5**

Roll-A-Ball as it is, is not much of a “game” and even less of a space to explore. You can win by collecting the pickups, but you can’t really lose. There is no challenge or narrative designed into the game, the outcome is predictable, and the ball is confined to an empty square platform. We want to fix all of this and make Roll-A-Ball into a better, more interesting game by considering the setting, level design, and perhaps a bit of risk 👀

Develop a short document/sketch that details your plans for expanding on the Roll-a-ball demo. Additionally, create an overlay image that will function as a “title card” to appear when the game starts.

**Be sure to include:**
- A description containing these elements:  
	1. A title
	2. What is the premise / idea / concept of this game? What is the player meant to "do"?
	3. Are there rules or mechanics that create winning or losing conditions?
	4. The overall space that your ball-character will traverse. Consider interior or exterior, scale (of player and/or the environment), obstacles, occlusions, viewpoints, and sense of place.
- Overlay image (PNG) that includes the premise and controls of the game. This overlay will be visible when your game starts and can be toggled on and off.

## 3. Build it

**Due by Thursday 10/12**
[~SUBMIT ROLLING BALL GAME HERE~]()

1. Use custom 3D assets to build out your world. These can include your own 3D models, found models, flat image cutouts, and more! Consider progression, distance, signposting, and other elements of level design that we cover in class. Does the level tell a story?
2. Add game mechanics that will expand on the Roll-a-ball tutorial. Consider ways that the player could lose (e.g., falling off the world, a time limit, things that could push you, becoming utterly lost, making poor fiscal decisions, spotted by a cat….). The Game should be able to restart when Win / Lose happens. 
3. Create a title overlay using 2D assets (Images, fonts, etc. from step 2 !😉) that has instructions for your game – this overlay should be visible when your game starts and should be able to be shown and hidden during the game by pressing the ‘q’ key.
4. Add sound to your game! Make a looping background track, sound effects for pickups, sound effects for other events, your own narration.

Please refer to the page on [preparing your game for submission](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more information on the build and documentation process.
