# Let's Play Project 2 Games

We're going to try and play Project 2 games on the cabinets. If your project doesn't belong on the cabinet let us know and we can play it another way.

## Things to consider

- What parts do players respond to VS which parts of the game did you spend the most time working on? 
- Does the game feel zine-like in any of the ways we've discussed in class?
- How do the mechanics (interaction, loop, challenges, etc.) align with the concepts, themes, and ideas within the game?
- Does the game allow for player expression? Do players feel agency while playing, or is the game meant to be a linear experience?
- What are ways to improve, balance, expand? Is there one aspect that feels very rich, but underutilized?
