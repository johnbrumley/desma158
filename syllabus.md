## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamentals of programming interactive projects in game development software. Classwork focuses on familiarizing students with game engines, computer programming concepts, player experience, and other skills that are foundational to making digital games. Lectures, exercises, and class projects teach skills needed to create digital games including custom rules, interactive physics systems, vectors, generative or randomized levels, save data, custom input systems, score-keeping, and sound. This course is offered in parallel with the concurrent courses, Game Design and Interactive Animation.

## Prerequisites

DESMA 24 Interactivity. 

We will revisit many of the same concepts covered in Interactivity, while using the C# scripting language and the Unity scripting API. If you haven't taken DESMA 24, but have prior experience with Unity and C# please let me know.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to create a real-time, interactive software with custom rules, generative or randomized levels, save data, responsive controls, physics, sound, and simple animation. The skills you will learn in this class translate well to immersive media, generative animation, and other modes of human-computer expression.

## Course Outline

> See the [schedule](schedule.md) for a more detailed breakdown of each class.

**Weeks 1–2**  
Introduction to game development tools, Unity Editor, C# introduction, visual language, and level design.

[Project 1: Ball Game (Due: Week 2)](project-1.md)  
Remix of the Roll-a-ball tutorial game that explores the possibilities of spatial narrative. Roll-a-ball is a quick tour of the Unity Editor, and also provides a foundation for creating something more expansive.

**Weeks 3–6**  
Working in 2D. Creating assets/sprites. Vector fundamentals, physics, and persistent data.

**Project 2: Flat Game (Due: Week 6)**  
Create a 2D "zine-game" based on your own life experience. Experiment with custom asset creation and collage techniques. Express ideas through game mechanics, custom inputs, and structure. Use code to incorporate vectors, physics, and collisions into your game.

**Weeks 7–10**  
Remix, sampling, streaming, custom input, mods.

**Project 3: Game as Engine (Due: Week 10)**  
Use Unity and/or other tools (emulators, recording software, existing games) to create a real-time, interactive work where games become the platform for expression. 

## Assignments & Grading

### Grading Breakdown

> - Project 1: 20%
> - Project 2: 30%
> - Project 3: 30%
> - Participation / Attendance / Homework : 20%
> - Extra Credit !✨%

### Evaluation

Approach each project with your own level of skill and comfort in mind. You should work to expand your technical skills, but also lean into your strengths. If you’re good at drawing, use a bunch of 2D drawings -- even if the world is 3D! If you’re into photography, use photocollage to build your game world!

Creative projects and proposals are graded based on these parameters:

- Submitting on time.
- Completing project deliverables.
- Attention to detail/craft. Does the project run? Are there unintended bugs, glitches, etc.
- Project scope / ambition / aesthetic and technical ambition. Are you doing the bare minimum, or are you pushing yourself technically or aesthetically?
- Creative risk taking and resourcefulness. Are you pushing the limits of the tools? Hacky solutions a perfectly acceptable!

Reading and lecture responses are pass/fail. As long as you thoughtfully complete them, you’ll get full credit.

### Submitting Projects

>See [submission guidelines](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more details

#### LATE WORK

Projects are due prior to the beginning of class on their respective due date.

After this time, a third of the letter grade will be deducted for assignments submitted after class has started, and a full letter grade will be deducted from the project grade for each class day that the assignment is late. For example, if an assignment due on Tuesday is submitted the following Thursday, an A grade would become a B. If it isn't submitted till the following Tuesday, the A would be marked down to a C.

Unity projects are complicated and can be annoying to backup. Make sure to save often and occasionally create a backup of your scenes. I recommend [exporting a unitypackage](how-to-submit-projects.md#Exporting%20Unity%20Packages) of your project and storing the package on an external drive or cloud backup. If you are comfortable with version control, there are a number of options ([1](https://unity.com/solutions/version-control) , [2](https://youtu.be/_ewoEQFEURg)).

**If you anticipate that you won’t be able to complete the work by the due date, please contact us *before* the due date so we can discuss options.**

#### ATTENDANCE

Please come to class on time at **2:00pm**. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be marked as late. Three late marks results in an unexcused absence. **Any disputes should be discussed with the TA within two weeks.**

**If you must miss class, email the TA prior to the class.** 
Absences will not be excused after the fact except in extreme circumstances. You get **one** unexcused absence without it affecting your grade. Each unexcused absence after that will result in one full letter grade deduction from your participation / attendance score.

#### APPROPRIATION, FAIR USE, AND GENERATED CONTENT

You should strive to develop your own assets for your project submissions. If major portions of your project have been borrowed or generated, particularly audio, visual, and textual content, they must be conceptually significant to your project and you should be able to justify their inclusion. While developing early stage prototypes and testing mechanics, it is perfectly acceptable to use placeholder assets.

### Required Reading

We will read a few chapters from Anna Anthropy's _Rise of the Videogame Zinesters_. We will provide excerpts of the chapters.  

### Getting help with Unity

There are lots of difficulties and bugs that can emerge while developing a project in Unity, and there are just as many solutions to these problems. More often than not, understanding what the problem is will point directly to the solution (so keep an eye on the console!). After you troubleshoot a problem once, you should be able to recognize and solve it the next time it appears. 

If you find yourself stumped by a problem, reach out to your classmates to see if someone else has experienced the same issue. We highly recommend that you, as a cohort, create a space for sharing and seeking support from each other, as many of you will share many of the same bugs, errors, and glitches.

#### Online resources

- The official [Unity User Manual and Scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) is an indispensable reference, keep it handy.
- https://learn.unity.com/ - You'll use this for Project 1. Lots of other tutorials based on specific aspects of the engine.
- Chatbots. ChatGPT and other bots have digested lots of Unity-related information. If you know the right way of framing your problem, a bot can provide a step-by-step tutorial for how to solve it.
- YouTube. Here are a few channels that are usually pretty good.
	- [Unity's official channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0RQ3O-nAuJd2LWm7lH5htrL)

### COVID-19

It is important that everyone stay safe and avoid coming to class if you have any concerns about your health status.  
  
If you find that external struggles and/or COVID related challenges are affecting your ability to attend class, please reach out to us. We want you to be successful in the class, but we care about your wellbeing more than anything else. Open communication with us is most important in this regard, and we will be very open to accommodating every reasonable request.

Students must adhere to the current campus directives related to COVID-19 mitigation, and refusal to do so may result in the student being asked to leave the classroom or referred to the Dean of Students. For more information about COVID-19 requirements on campus, please visit: [https://covid-19.ucla.edu/information-for-students/](https://covid-19.ucla.edu/information-for-students/). 

### Land Acknowledgement

The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is the first step in the work toward supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination. Read more about what land you’re occupying: [https://native-land.ca/](https://native-land.ca/) 

### Commitment to Diversity & Safer Spaces:

We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA. _*Statement adopted from voidLab at:_ [_https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement_](https://github.com/voidlab/diversity-statement) 

### Center for Accessible Education (CAE)

The UCLA Center for Accessible Education (CAE) is responsible for ensuring students with documented disabilities have access to an inclusive, supportive learning environment. Students with disabilities or other needs requiring academic accommodations should speak with me as early in the quarter as possible to be sure they get the support they need.

Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE) at (310) 825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. When possible, students should contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. For more information visit [www.cae.ucla.edu](http://www.cae.ucla.edu/). 

### Academic Integrity and Information on Student Conduct

UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings usually resulting in suspension or dismissal. As specified in the [UCLA Student Conduct Code](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/studentconductcode), violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic dishonesty. When a student is suspected to have engaged in academic dishonesty, Academic Senate regulations require that the instructor report the allegation to the office of the Dean of Students. For more information, see the [UCLA Student Conduct Code](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/studentconductcode).
