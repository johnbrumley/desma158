Cocktail cabinets in traditional wood-paneled environment

Remake a classic **2D** arcade game, such as space invaders, pong, or breakout. Experiment with the structure of the game, create your own narrative theme, apply new knowledge about interaction design, keeping score, physics, and colliders.

Trouble deciding on a game? You can play many classic games on archive.org’s [Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade?tab=about) (also a good way to see a lot of arcade cabinet art).

#### Deliverables

- **Playable on arcade machine**. Design a game to be played on one of the UCLA Game Lab cocktail cabinet machines.
- **Persistent data**. Either as a high score table, or data that influences the state of a persistent world.
- **Meaningful multiplayer** experience. Indirect competition with a high score table is the minimum.
- **Game feel**. Consider sound design, animation, and more to improve the “feel” of your game.

UCLA Game Lab cocktail cabinet in two-player “corner” configuration

The games will be played on the Game Lab cocktail cabinets, so consider the player positioning, arcade stick inputs, multi-player experience, screen setting and format.

A cocktail arcade cabinet is a modular arcade cabinet shaped like a table. A gaming PC and a monitor placed horizontally under a layer of glass, and players sit around the table looking downward at the game. The Game Lab cocktail cabinets can support up to four players in a wide variety of configurations; controllers slot into each of the four sides of the table. There are four cocktail cabinets in different colors.

## 1. Game Design Document

**Due by Thursday 10/19**

Develop a short design document that describes your arcade game remake in in terms of both narrative theming and structural differences from the original game. This includes creating a stylized title logo and concept artwork based on arcade cabinet design. Additionally, mock up a screenshot of what the gameplay and in-game characters will look like.

##### SUBMIT THE DOCUMENT VIA THE GOOGLE FORM BELOW

[Submit Design Document Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfC-MyUZH-5k8RSjd2rfzjLXk0CtlFezffXzD_CppeippeSSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

#### Requirements:

1. Game Title
2. _Written out_ paragraph describing the game, and must include:
    
    - The title and description of the theme. Who are the characters? What are they trying to do?
    - Describe (for the player to read) – who is the player in the context of the game, what is their goal, and what are the challenges that they will have to face (thematically and mechanically)?
    
    - Describe the controls. What can the player do, and how do they interact with the arcade machine to do it?
    - How will you incorporate multiplayer? Competition, high-scores, leaving notes, etc.
3. Image (PNG) of concept art / logo. This does not need to be graphically accurate. See examples of classic arcade cabinet artwork. Consider incorporating the title of the game into the concept art.
4. Mock-up gameplay “screenshot”

## 2. Prototype It

**Show in class on Thursday 10/26**

Start by building a graybox prototype of your arcade game. Grayboxing is a level design practice where you build a rough, blocked-out version of your game using basic elements (usually gray boxes). This is a common practice for developing and debugging game mechanics, inputs, and interaction design separately from the art and sound elements of the game.

Try and build as much of your arcade game focusing on just the mechanics, systems, and behaviors. Use built-in Unity assets or placeholders. You’ll be able to focus on art, writing, sound, and other game polish in the third part of the assignment.

There is no formal submission for this stage of the project, but we will share prototypes in class. It is important to have a working (or partially working) prototype so we can give feedback and support.

## 3. Build it

**Due by Tuesday 11/7**

[Submit Project 2: Arcade Game](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7zlSBJC49o1IzTR2iO8onocIxwaEi56OequjLAnLixXXOgw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

1. Build the remake of a classic 2D arcade game. Expand or modify the mechanics. Change the theming and narrative, tell a story, make the game your own.
2. Make a Title Screen with an “attract” mode. Display high scores and game instructions. You can optionally also include “demo” gameplay. Pressing a button will start a new game. Many, many examples [here](https://youtu.be/ZQGzX80vBpI).
3. Create persistent data. This can be with a scoring system that results in a high scores leaderboard, or another system that is stored across games.
4. The game should be multiplayer in some sense. The minimum version of multiplayer is using high scores to create indirect competition, but you can consider other modes of multiplayer.
5. Add in game feel elements. Background music, sound effects, animations, and more!

Please refer to the page on [preparing your game for submission](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more information on the build and documentation process.
