*Cocktail cabinets in their  natural, wood-paneled habitat*

Create a 2D "zine" videogame based your own life experience. Experiment with custom asset creation and collage techniques. Express ideas through game mechanics, custom inputs, and structure. Use code to incorporate vectors, physics, and collisions into your game.

Videogames create embodied experiences by giving us control over our player-character, to allow them to make choices, and to interact with the rules of a designed world. Zines are small, self-published and distributed books that contain, among other things, stories, musings, collages, photographs, drawings, and research. Often low budget, experimental, and highly personal, zines have a directness and intimacy that cannot be replicated in mass media. 

In this project, you'll create a videogame-as-a-zine that recreates a personal-artifact (an object, a memory, a place, etc.) as something that can be played, interacted with, or reenacted. Topics can be as literal or abstract as you would like, and can range from mundane and everyday to humorous to serious to practical. 

Being a game, you'll need to consider the types of rules that players will confront. We'll look at and play both classic arcade games to more contemporary, zine-like games. We've also created a 2D template project that can be used as the basis for your own, more expansive project.
## Basic Deliverables
- **Playable on arcade machine**. Design a game to be played on one of the UCLA Game Lab cocktail cabinet machines. Builds should be complete and bug-free.
- **Custom character and world assets.** Experiment with asset creation to create something unique. Consider photographs, sketches, screenshots, or anything that can be turned into a 2D image.
- **Persistent data**. Incorporate some information or state that will save across playthroughs. This could include scores, times, messages, or changes to the game world.
- **Game feel**. Consider sound design, animation, and more to improve the “feel” of your game.
## Extras
- **Meaningful multiplayer** experience. Use direct or indirect competition/collaboration to create a communal experience.

*UCLA Game Lab cocktail cabinet in two-player “corner” configuration*

The games will be played on the Game Lab cocktail cabinets, so take the format and context into consideration when designing your game. We've included input settings for the cabinets in our shared template.

>A cocktail arcade cabinet is a modular arcade cabinet shaped like a table. A gaming PC and a monitor placed horizontally under a layer of glass, and players sit around the table looking downward at the game. The Game Lab cocktail cabinets can support up to four players in a wide variety of configurations; controllers slot into each of the four sides of the table. There are four cocktail cabinets in different colors.

## 1. Game Design Document

**Due by Thursday 10/19**
[Submit Design Document Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfC-MyUZH-5k8RSjd2rfzjLXk0CtlFezffXzD_CppeippeSSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Develop a short design document that describes your game in in terms of both narrative theming and game mechanics. Additionally, mock up a screenshot or storyboard of what the gameplay, characters, and progression will look like. 

We'll meet with everyone to discuss your design documents in class. We can give some guidance about implementation and where to get started. 
### Requirements:
1. A working title
2. _Written out_ paragraph describing the game, and must include:
    - A description of the theme. What your idea is and how you're planning to realize it. Who is the main character(s)? What are they trying to do? What is the world/situation/activity/etc.?
    - What are the rules of the game or how does the player interact with these rules to complete the game (i.e. hold right, talk to everyone, build a sand castle, get to the chopper)
3. Image of concept art including a mock-up gameplay “screenshot”

## 2. Prototype It
**Show in class on Thursday 10/26**

Start by building a graybox prototype of your game. Grayboxing is a level design practice where you build a rough, blocked-out version of your game using basic elements (usually gray boxes). This is a common practice for developing and debugging game mechanics, inputs, and interaction design separately from the art, sound, and text elements of the game.

Try and build as much of your game focusing on just the mechanics, systems, and behaviors. Use built-in Unity assets or placeholders. You’ll be able to focus on art, writing, sound, and other game polish in the third part of the assignment.

There is no formal submission for this stage of the project, but we will share prototypes in class. It is important to have a working (or partially working) prototype so we can give feedback and support.
## 3. Build it
**Due by Tuesday 11/7**
[Submit Project 2: Flat Game](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7zlSBJC49o1IzTR2iO8onocIxwaEi56OequjLAnLixXXOgw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

1. **Build your 2D game**. 
2. Include a **Title Scene** with an “attract” mode. *Optionally:* Display high scores and game instructions. You can optionally also include “demo” gameplay. Pressing a button will start a new game. Many, many examples [here](https://youtu.be/ZQGzX80vBpI).
3. Create **persistent data**. This could be a scoring system that results in a high scores leaderboard, or something else that gets stored across playthroughs.
4. **Custom character and world assets.** Photographs, sketches, screenshots, or anything that can be turned into a 2D image can become part of your game. Combine, collage, and experiment.
5. Add in game feel elements. Background music, sound effects, animations, and more!
6. *Optional:* Some form of multiplayer. Consider different modes of multiplayer from direct to indirect competition to collaboration.

Please refer to the page on [preparing your game for submission](how-to-submit-projects.md) for more information on the build and documentation process.

Trouble deciding on a game? You can play many classic games on archive.org’s [Internet Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade?tab=about) (also a good way to see a lot of arcade cabinet art).
