Metagames, remix, sampling, streaming, custom input, mods, machinima

Use Unity and/or other tools (emulators, recording software, existing games) to create a real-time, interactive work where games become the platform for expression.

>And even though metagames have always existed alongside games, the concept has taken on renewed importance and political urgency in a media landscape in which videogames not only colonize and enclose the very concept of games, play, and leisure but ideologically conflate the creativity, criticality, and craft of play with the act of consumption. When did the term game become synonymous with hardware warranties, packaged products, intellectual property, copyrighted code, end user licenses, and digital rights management? When did rules become conflated with the physical, mechanical, electrical, and computational operations of technical media? When did player become a code word for customer? When did we stop making metagames?

>After all, metagames are not just games about games. They are not simply the games we play in, on, around, and through games or before, during, and after games. From the most complex house rules, arcade cultures, competitive tournaments, and virtual economies to the simple decision to press start, pass the controller, use a playerâ€™s guide, or even purchase a game in the first place, for all intents and purposes metagames are the only kind of games that we play.

# Mapping Metagames

Let's consider Google Maps as a Game Engine and take a look at ways that it has been approached:

# Navigating the Stack

Google maps is just a one node within a larger network of other tools, software, interfaces, devices, infrastructures, etc. 

Shifting your focus can bring into light another potential game engine.

One layer below. GPS is an underlying technology which Google Maps relies on. Wayfinding using location data sensors becomes itself a tool for exploration.

*iPhone Oil Paintings* JK Keller (2012) 

One layer above. The device used to view google maps (screen, phone, etc.) and our physical incompatibility with with these objects can be a different path.

If you are interested in an object -- platforms, software, hardware, relationships -- but are unsure about how to approach it as an engine, consider the layers surrounding that object (above, below, and adjacent).

Some Questions to ask:
- What are the inputs? Can I intervene?
- What are the outputs? Can I intervene?
- Can it be combined with something else?

>... \[metagaming\] has become a popularly used and particularly useful label for a diverse form of play, a game design paradigm, and a way of life occurring not only around videogames but around all forms of digital technology.

When playing a game, we don't really think of ourselves as manipulating and executing code as much as attempting to "play" within the constraints or rules dictated by the designer/programmer and enforced by the computer. 

Moving from playing games to designing games, the computation aspect becomes more apparent even while a Game Engine abstracts the low level puttering involved in the staging and display of the game. But as a designer, there is no the that the player can ultimately become a programmer and rewrite your own game.

Speedrunning is another form of hacking, but only with in-universe tools.

# Camera Tools

[Assemble with Care](https://www.assemblegame.com/)

Knowing a bit more about working with cameras in Unity can be especially useful when it comes to building projects that sample, recombine, or display live, external imagery.

I'll cover some important tools to know about and a few tricks:

# Camera component

The Camera ([Standard](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Camera.html)) ([URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/camera-component-reference.html)) 

![](https://docs.unity3d.com/uploads/Main/InspectorCamera35.png)

A Standard Render Pipeline camera component

![](assets/urp-camera.png)
URP Camera component

The URP camera adds a significant number of options compared to the default camera component. It can be good to glance at the [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/camera-component-reference.html) to see what everything does, but some settings are much more commonly used than others:

- **Projection**: Change camera between Perspective and Orthographic
- **Field of view (FOV)**: How wide (or tall) of an area is visible to the camera. Larger FOV means you can see more.

![](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1743850/extras/HyperDemonPhantasmagoria.gif?t=1675218040)

[Hyper Demon](https://hyprd.mn/) is a game that encourages high FOV to keep track of everything around you.

- **Clipping planes**: What are the closest and farthest distances that a camera can "see"
- **Post Processing**: Check the box if you want to use post processing effects (global volume)
- **Anti-aliasing**: Smooths out any "jaggy" lines. Can be heavy on processing
- **Culling Mask**: Control which layers that the camera can see
- **Occlusion Culling**: hide objects that the camera can't see
- **Background Type**: What is drawn behind everything (like background in p5)
- **Output Texture**: Important if you want to use the camera with a [Render Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html)
- **Target Display**: Control where the camera displays, can use for multi-screen output
- **Viewport Rect**: Control how much of the camera view is rendered to the screen (useful for split screen)

Some intense aliasing
# Render Texture

Camera output isn't limited to a display. You can add the output to other objects in the scene using a [Render Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html)

Here's a short setup step-by-step for connecting a camera output to a material using a render texture:

1. In the Project Panel: **Create > Render Texture** 
2. By default these are 256x256. It's a good idea to only increase the texture size based on where it's being used. If the texture is looking too low-res, try increasing the dimensions.
3. In the Hierarchy of your scene, add a new camera: **Create > Camera**
4. Drag the Render Texture to the new Camera's **Output Texture** property.
5. Create a new Material and drag the Render Texture into the "BaseMap" property (you could also experiment with using the render texture elsewhere).
6. Attach the material to an object, plane, UI element (Raw Image)
7. Press play and the output of the camera should appear on the object.

![](assets/render-texture.png)

# Webcam input

Getting the input from a webcam uses a slightly different type of texture called a [WebCamTexture](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.html)  

The demo script from [this page](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.Play.html) is a fast way to get webcam input into Unity:

```csharp
// Starts the default camera and assigns the texture to the current renderer
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;  
  
public class GetWebCam : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
       WebCamTexture webcamTexture = new WebCamTexture();
       Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
       renderer.material.mainTexture = webcamTexture;
       webcamTexture.Play();
    }
}
```

Attach this script to an object in your scene and it will replace the BaseMap color of the material with the WebCamTexture

# Virtual Webcam Input

If I want to route video from another program on my computer, I can create a "Virtual Webcam" to pass the input into Unity using the WebCamTexture.

I like to use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to capture a screen or window and then start up a Virtual Webcam. In Unity, you'll need to tell the WebCamTexture to use that device. There are other ways of routing video within a computer ([syphon](https://syphon.github.io/) for mac, [spout](https://spout.zeal.co/) for windows)

In the controls section of OBS you can start/stop the virtual camera:

![](webcam-obs-vcam.png)

Because the script above will always pick the first camera, you'll need to modify it a bit to figure out which camera is the OBS virtual camera:

```csharp
// Starts the default camera and assigns the texture to the current renderer
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class GetWebCam : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        WebCamDevice[] devices = WebCamTexture.devices;
        WebCamTexture webcamTexture = new WebCamTexture();

        if (devices.Length > 0)
        {
            // print names of all connected devices
            foreach (var d in devices) print(d.name);
            // set the device
            webcamTexture.deviceName = devices[0].name;

            Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
            renderer.material.mainTexture = webcamTexture;

            webcamTexture.Play();
        }
    }
}
```

If you run the game with the updated script, you'll see the names of the devices in the console. I can see that OBS is the second device:

![](assets/webcam-device-names.png)

You can directly set the device name in the script, 

```csharp
webcamTexture.deviceName = "OBS Virtual Camera";
```

or I can change the index of the webcam device from 0 to 1

```csharp
webcamTexture.deviceName = devices[1].name;
```

![](assets/webcam-vcam-texture.png)

Applying the virtual camera input as a texture on an object

# Reading Pixels

For grabbing pixels off a Camera or Render Texture see [ReadPixels](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture2D.ReadPixels.html)

WebCamTexture has it's own version of reading pixels called [GetPixels](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WebCamTexture.GetPixels.html)

In both cases, you'll be writing the output to a new texture or material rather than editing the pixels of the texture before it is passed to a display.

Here's an example of reading the pixel array from a webcam input (extending the previous webcam code from above):

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class GetWebCam : MonoBehaviour
{
    WebCamTexture webcamTexture;
    Color[] data; // use Color32[] if you need better performance
    Material averageMaterial;
    
    void Start()
    {
        WebCamDevice[] devices = WebCamTexture.devices;
        webcamTexture = new WebCamTexture();

        if (devices.Length > 0)
        {
            // print names of all connected devices
            foreach (var d in devices) print(d.name);

            webcamTexture.deviceName = devices[0].name;

            // store the material to change later
            Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
            averageMaterial = renderer.material;

            webcamTexture.Play();
        }
    }

    void Update()
    {
        data = webcamTexture.GetPixels();
        
        // e.g. find the average color
        float r = 0f;
        float g = 0f;
        float b = 0f;
        foreach(var col in data)
        {
            r += col.r;
            b += col.b;
            g += col.g;
        }

        int len = data.Length;
        Color avgColor = new Color(r/len, g/len, b/len);

        // set the color of the material
        averageMaterial.SetColor("_BaseColor", avgColor);
    }
}
```

This begins to encroach into the territory of shaders (or shader graphs) -- URP has a built-in [Fullscreen Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@16.0/manual/post-processing/post-processing-custom-effect-low-code.html) that can be used to design custom post processing effects.

# Decal Projectors

It is not uncommon to add complexity, shadows, markings, logos, etc. to surfaces without wanting to create a custom texture. This can be achieved using a [decal projector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/renderer-feature-decal.html)

![](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/images/decal/decal-projector-bounding-box.png)

For URP, you can add a decal projector to your scene by right-clicking in the hierarchy and selecting **Rendering > URP Decal Projector**.

In order to use the decal projector, you'll need to add the decal projector [render feature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/urp-renderer-feature-how-to-add.html) to your URP settings. Conveniently, Unity tells you that you need to add it and gives you a link:

![](assets/urp-decal-projector-add-feature-button.png)

Click "open" to change the view of the inspector and then find "Add Renderer Feature > Decal"

![](assets/urp-add-decal.png)

This should reload the scene and the decal projector will be available to use. URP decal projectors use a custom shader found in Shader Graphs/ Decal:

![](assets/urp-decal-shader.png)

The decal projector, depending on the width, height, and projection depth settings in the component will apply a texture (and/or normal map) onto a surface based on it's forward z-direction:

![](assets/urp-decal-example.png)
# Boring Challenge

Set up a live mini map using an overhead camera, render texture, and a UI Raw Image. For an extra challenge, use culling layers on the cameras to have the character look different on the mini map.

> Hint: You need to use an unlit UI material on the RawImage

![](assets/render-texture-minimap.png)

# Better Challenge

Using camera techniques from above, mix together video from inside and outside Unity. Create video feedback loops. Mash up multiple video sources and project them onto 3D objects. Add yourself to the mix with a webcam. Add remote performers from zoom using virtual cameras. Anything can become a source from inside and outside of Unity.
