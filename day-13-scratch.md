Metagames, remix, sampling, streaming, custom input, mods, machinima

Use Unity and/or other tools (emulators, recording software, existing games) to create a real-time, interactive work where games become the platform for expression.

>And even though metagames have always existed alongside games, the concept has taken on renewed importance and political urgency in a media landscape in which videogames not only colonize and enclose the very concept of games, play, and leisure but ideologically conflate the creativity, criticality, and craft of play with the act of consumption. When did the term game become synonymous with hardware warranties, packaged products, intellectual property, copyrighted code, end user licenses, and digital rights management? When did rules become conflated with the physical, mechanical, electrical, and computational operations of technical media? When did player become a code word for customer? When did we stop making metagames?

>After all, metagames are not just games about games. They are not simply the games we play in, on, around, and through games or before, during, and after games. From the most complex house rules, arcade cultures, competitive tournaments, and virtual economies to the simple decision to press start, pass the controller, use a player’s guide, or even purchase a game in the first place, for all intents and purposes metagames are the only kind of games that we play.

> What's really valuable about hacking and modifying games is the realization that there are ways of interacting with games other than just playing them: roles beyond consumer. Inventing rules is, after all, inventing games.

>a diverse form of play, a game design paradigm, and a way of life occurring not only around videogames but around all forms of digital technology.



>Prepositions are to parts of speech as _metagames_ are to games. A signifier for everything occurring before, after, between, and during games as well as everything located in, on, around, and beyond games, the metagame anchors the game in time and space.
