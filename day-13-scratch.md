# Intro to Project 3

# Getting ready for Project 3

Project 3 is going to be all about Randomness and generation with a bit of simulation thrown in as well.

  

What are things that can be generated?

**Project 3: Game as Engine (Due: Week 10)**  

Remix, sampling, streaming, custom input, mods.

Use Unity and/or other tools (emulators, recording software, existing games) to create a real-time, interactive work where games become the platform for expression.

>After all, metagames are not just games about games. They are not simply the games we play in, on, around, and through games or before, during, and after games. From the most complex house rules, arcade cultures, competitive tournaments, and virtual economies to the simple decision to press start, pass the controller, use a player’s guide, or even purchase a game in the first place, for all intents and purposes metagames are the only kind of games that we play. 

>And even though metagames have always existed alongside games, the concept has taken on renewed importance and political urgency in a media landscape in which videogames not only colonize and enclose the very concept of games, play, and leisure but ideologically conflate the creativity, criticality, and craft of play with the act of consumption. When did the term game become synonymous with hardware warranties, packaged products, intellectual property, copyrighted code, end user licenses, and digital rights management? When did rules become conflated with the physical, mechanical, electrical, and computational operations of technical media? When did player become a code word for customer? When did we stop making metagames?

>a diverse form of play, a game design paradigm, and a way of life occurring not only around videogames but around all forms of digital technology.

>Prepositions are to parts of speech as _metagames_ are to games. A signifier for everything occurring before, after, between, and during games as well as everything located in, on, around, and beyond games, the metagame anchors the game in time and space.
