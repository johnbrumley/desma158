(I should avoid heavily talky games though and more on environment exploration)


# big questions:
1. No more Discord. How would we manage -- maybe let students manage their own discord and we can have a pipeline of questions -- but try and emphasize office hours.
2. No more design docs ... just have students bring in sketches
	1. should we have them brainstorm multiple ideas at once and narrow down?
3. Less lectures (reduced scope), more in-class workshops / micro game building exercises. More in-class time to work on projects
4. No cocktail cabinet for P2 -- changing p2 to not be arcade game, but might still be good as intro to inputs
5. Teach GPT or other LLM for getting Unity help (workshop)


p1 todo (days 1-5)
- [ ] Day 2: insert level sketch workshop into day 2
- [ ] Day 3: Replace c# things with an intro to some prebuilt scenes that demo how to incorporate custom scripts. focus more on materials, objects, lighting, sound
- [ ] Day 4: Need to check ... but are we gonna do builds?


p2 todo (days 6-12)
- [ ] Insert photo workshop thing

1. day 6: 
	1. intro project 2
		1. talk zines, maybe early net art (digital zine?), queer games? 
	2. demo the project template (include platforme char controller for wkshp? or should we build these out?), 
	3. C# scripting basics here also (sandwich between fun stuff)
	4. Homeplay Assignment
	5. Reading? Ch. 1 of Anthropy (maybe an excerpt)
2. day 7: 
	1. Start covering how to script triggers, collisions, vector movement? maybe inventories here.
	2. talk more about collage things demo postcard game (in-class?)

# TODO

- [ ] Decision on cocktail cabinet -- maybe can still work??!?!? but it'd be less arcade-like
- [ ] **!!!!!Things on Project 3 **-- indeterminate might be good, but mainly I'd like to emphasize uses of Unity beyond games --visualizations, mediating interactions, APIs, maybe I should borrow some of the everything as an input or everyday immersions -- maybe "Beyond Games" and we run a few workshops before asking students for design docs (maybe wk 7) .... should students vote on topics?  
- [ ] Review the syllabus -- update policies, expectations, late / attendance
- [ ] Rebalance tutorials / workshops for updated projects
- [ ] look at adding Carlin's writing as a roll-a-ball text: https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/56/wing.php 
- [ ] ball music playlist? -- https://youtu.be/PtYrJJIyVL4?si=LEWW9wIcgeeIdz-L 
- [ ] ball video playlist
- [ ] add levitating mass things,, talk about the path through LA and logistics
- [ ] drawing -- or physically making (https://www.target.com/p/hexbug-vex-ball-challenge-bank-shot/-/A-85378893) -- ball course --> https://screwballscramble.net/

quote from pnin:
> "During the eight years Pnin had taught at Waindell College he had changed his lodgings... about every semester. The accumulation of consecutive rooms in his memory now resembled those displays of grouped elbow chairs on show, and beds, and lamps, and inglenooks which, ignoring all space-time distinctions, commingle in the soft light of a furniture store beyond which it snows, and the dusk deepens, and nobody really loves anybody."

quote from [smithson](https://holtsmithsonfoundation.org/tour-monuments-passaic-new-jersey)
>  Everything about the site remained wrapped in blandness and littered with shiny cars—one after another they extended into a sunny nebulosity. The indifferent backs of the cars flashed and reflected the stale afternoon sun. I took a few listless, entropic snapshots of that lustrous monument. If the future is “out of date” and “old fashioned,” then I had been in the future. I had been on a planet that had a map of Passaic drawn over it, and a rather imperfect map at that. A sidereal map marked up with “lines” the size of streets, and “squares” and “blocks” the size of buildings. At any moment my feet were apt to fall through the cardboard ground. I am convinced that the future is lost somewhere in the dumps of the non-historical past; it is in yesterday’s newspapers, in the _jejune_ advertisements of science- fiction movies, in the false mirror of our rejected dreams. Time turns metaphors into _things_, and stacks them up in cold rooms, or places them in the celestial playgrounds of the suburbs.

workshop ideas:

rolling ball -- drawing levels 
- draw a level on paper, then gray box ?
- fast gray box version that uses one of the level design typologies
- design a level from something a non-spatial thing -- level based on a song, a character's worldview, a random Wikipedia article, an abstract concept
- maybe an invisible city builder?
flat game
- take photo of something in the classroom (no pre-building) and make a level out of it (might have to use a 2D character controller? Or could make it top-down)
- face game? make your face a level? 
auto game
- maybe generative sound workshop? 
- custom input -- maybe api checks -- maybe uduino -- maybe repurposing mouse / keyboard / controller -- sound as input control -- webcam as input
- 


Possible things for project 3:
- Randomness
- Simulation
- Installation-style?
- Custom Inputs -- might go along with tangible media -- but could just be novel usage of keyboard / mouse / gamepad
- Visualization
- Mixed Reality / Tangible Media -- most complicated would be switch (but not everyone has an arduino and it isn't required for the class .... so it might be pushing things too much) -- maybe disguising a keyboard or mouse or hacking a USB gamepad to become a switch?
- Music Engine
- ~~Multiplayer / Collective interaction (maybe lucky dragon style?)~~ too many weeds
- Location-based (I can give a script .... but only works on mobile builds so might disqualify this)
- ~~Webcam input~~ ... cool, but not sure yet how student's could use
- ~~Phone (iphone) as camera control / gyro~~ .... also not so clear



Maybe these are too much -- though certain ones could be incorporated into some small workshop days to cover very different aspects of Unity -- though I'd really like to make sure that everyone has enough time

indeterminate game, aleatoric game, chance game, autonomous game -- game that runs on it's own as a simulation or generative 

Maybe P3 can be more about the player of the game --- the player (s) as performers? Which could be human or non-human .... maybe this is too abstract? 

# types of games

slow game -- make the slowest game
kaizo game -- make a game that forces the player to cheat to win
many game -- make a game that won't work unless 10 people are all pressing buttons
sleep game -- make a game that only works when you are asleep
hat game -- make a game that fits / sits on a head
move game -- make a game that forces the player to re-orient their body / perspective
close game -- make a game where you have to sit very very close to the screen
shy game -- make a game that only runs when you aren't looking
wordle -- don't make wordle
chair game -- make a game chair, or a chair that game
me game -- make a game that is also a mirror
tree game -- make a game that can only be played by a tree
string game -- make a game where you pull a string
window game -- make a game that is played by looking through a neighbor's window
water game -- make a game, and water is somewhere

I like the idea of having multiple sketch options -- maybe instead of "design doc" I can just say make 2 sketches -- maybe it's good to drop the initial form submissio?

# old tips from the last p3 page (probably add this to the day of class that we talk about the project )

## Tips:
- Use prefabs and the Instantiate function to place objects in the scene.
- Use arrays or lists to contain references to your prefabs
- Consider building “compound objects” out of modular pieces. Consider using empty transforms to represent possible connection points.
- Use the Random functions and/or Perlin Noise to introduce chance into your project.
- Consider what constraints or rules you can impose to create unique forms and color palettes.
- You may work in 2D or 3D. Lean into your strengths as a visual designer / artist as much as possible with this project! (And also remember you only have a few weeks!)
- Interaction is not required for this assignment, but consider how a viewer will see or experience your generative designs. Can they orbit the camera around? Can they press a button to generate new objects?

long quote from Foddy (need to trim)
> For years now, people have been predicting that games would soon be made out of pre-fabricated objects; bought in a store and assembled into a world, and for the most part that hasn’t happened, because the objects in the stores are trash. I don’t mean that they look bad, or that they’re badly made- although a lot of them are- I mean they’re trash in the way that food becomes trash as soon as you put it in the sink. Things are made to be consumed and used in a certain context, and once the moment is gone they transform into garbage. In the context of technology, those moments pass by in seconds.
> 
> Over time, we’ve poured more and more refuse into this vast digital landfill that we call the internet. It now vastly outnumbers and outweighs the things that are fresh, and untainted, and unused. When everything around us is cultural trash, trash becomes the new medium- the lingua franca of the digital age- and you can build culture out of trash, but only trash culture: b-games, b-movies, b-music, b-philosophy. Maybe this is what digital culture is. A monstrous mountain of trash, the ash-heap of creativity’s fountain. A landfill with everything we ever thought of in it. Grand, infinite, and unsorted.
> 
> There’s 3D models of breakfast. Gen Xer’s fanfic novels. Scanned magazines, green-screen Shia Laboeuf, banned snuff scenes on Liveleak. Facebook’s got lifelike bots with unbranded adverts and candid shots of Kanye and Taylor Swift mashups- car crash epic fail .gifs, Russian dashcam vids, discussions of McRibs! Discarded, forgotten, unrecycled. Muddled, rotten, untitled.
> 
> Everything’s fresh for about six seconds- until some newer thing beckons- and we hit refresh, and there’s years of perservering disappearing into the pile; out of style, out of sight. In this context, it’s tempting to make friendly content that’s gentle- that lets you churn through it but not earn it. Why make something demanding if it just gets piled up in the landfill, filed in with the bland things?

# (notes from Hiroshi -- it's all on the slack but this is a bit easier to read)

I had a meeting with Sony team. It turned out they are very supportive  
Important discussion point was about the interior radio+display. Please give me your opinions!!  

- Are we using the embedded PC, or bringing our own PC (or PI?)? For me, bringing ours seems get things simple (of course cost increase a bit), but what do you think?
- For the radio program design, how much variation are we providing?  I thought it would be nice if we can upload/change the program timely, but what do you think?

Regarding the exterior visualization, it seems we can utilize a powerful PC embedded on the vehicle. Probably we can deploy our app on it.  

- To proceed this it would be good to have more technical details. Do we need inputs from vehicle (position information, start trigger)? Do we need other information from cloud (SNS, weather, and so on)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Here's the summary of the meeting with sony.  

Concerning the computers and hardware specs\
	- There are two computers embedded on the vehicle, PC1 and PC2. PC1 is for interior display and PC2 is for the exterior displays
## PC1
- Designed for MR application (getting camera feed from outside and mix graphics) built on Unity.
- We can have several programs on it. By using remote the operator can manually change the program
- PC1 is communicating with the vehicle controller, hence if we are installing additional app on PC1 we need to do it carefully (e.g., NW traffic )
- **We could utilize MR app as a player for video file (e.g. .mp4), however, interactive functionality (for example, getting sensor input and modify contents) is not implemented**
## PC2
- Connected to front, back, left right, in total four displays (sorry, I told you a wrong information before!)
- Because of the rendering performance they are currently showing same image on front/back and left/right.
- Spec seems powerful
- They are more optimistic about installing additional app on PC2


- Physical space for additional computers are not so much. We may be able to put small computer, however, there is not so much space for tower PC
- The vehicle has plenty of the battery (we need to evaluate the performance in cold winter though)
- We can get trigger information by putting magnetic tag on the ground. The sensor on the vehicle detects it and gives PCs the signal.
- Embedded internet is used for the vehicle. However if we need internet for us we can simply add wifi router

# Discussion point

## PC for interior

### **Utilizing PC1, or bringing our own PC?** It depends on how much variation/interactivity we want to add, + debug/trouble shooting

- Utilizing PC1:
	- Playing one fixed program on PC1
	- always use a same program which consists of recorded sound /rendered video for a day. Creating this program beforehand (last night or early morning?) and upload it to the PC1 in the morning. This program is always running on the vehicle. In this case we don't have to develop player app for interior, however it always plays the same program
	- Preparing several programs and select by manual operation on PC1
	- e.g. sunny version and snowy version
	- uploads multiple programs to the PC1, and the operator changes the contents based on the situation.  More variety than one fixed program, however manual operation might be a bit troublesome
### Not utilizing PC1, and bringing our own PC

- Basically we can get more freedom
- We can choose one fixed program/uploading several programs and choose the best one automatically, or can we upload contents with proper timing (in the morning, noon, evening, or when the weather changes, ...?)

## PC for exterior

- Since the PC2 seems powerful, we can develop the visualization app (Unity?) and deploy it on PC2?
- Nevertheless it would be good to discuss how much interactivity we are bringing to the exterior visualization to define system specification
