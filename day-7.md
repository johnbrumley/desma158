# Early Video Games and Arcades

Arcades, amusement centers, pinball parlors, penny arcades – mechanical and electro-mechanical games of skill and chance existed long before the video game. 

Devices that could fit into a cabinet were often found in bars and halls, more associated with adult-oriented amusement (full circle → Barcade, D&B).

Pinball was banned from the 1940s to 1976 in New York City by Mayor LaGuardia due to the association with gambling and moral depravity. ([playfield of this game](https://www.ipdb.org/showpic.pl?id=2460&picno=59496))

Ultimately, with the addition of flipper mechanisms, it was demonstrated to be a game of skill and no longer outlawed.

Pong was introduced by Atari (Bushnell and Dabney) in 1972

…”arcade games train players in gaming behaviors by rewarding them through points, game time, and the ability to access subsequent levels, or by explicitly ranking them against other players on top score lists”

“While video games are frequently understood as simulations, the arcade itself can also be seen as a simulation of emergent economic values and practices that have persisted long past the eclipse of the arcade’s zenith.”

Kocurek, Coin-operated Americans 

Before the magic lantern, in order to see a large picture, you needed to go to a church or a rich person’s house … in the late 60s you would have had to visit a research lab if you wanted to see a video game, until 1972 when the first arcade machine was introduced.

Arcades in the 1970s and early 80s were characterized by a few features:

## Access to technology 

Most people didn’t have access to computers, so arcades were an early way to demonstrate the potential of what computers could do. Having to leave home to visit these computers, creating social gathering points.
## Short loop of the game and gambling 

Part of the economics of the arcade meant that games needed to be finished quickly to increase revenue. A quarter might only give you 30-60s of gameplay. Learning a game meant spending a lot of money, often making only minor progress with each quarter. When some players were good enough to play for extended periods in a single quarter, some owners would force them to quit or cut the power to the machine.
## Strict rule systems (disciplinary machines) vs open-ended or emergent games

Arcade games are generally linear, “games of progression” with strict ways that the game is intended to be played. This results in a model of mastery of a particular rule set.

A game like Pong is considered more of an emergent game, though the coin-operated nature of the arcade version, as opposed to a home version, doesn’t reward experimentation.

Arcade cabinets existed outside of the Arcade proper (where one would go with the intent to play games). In restaurants, waiting rooms, laundromats, bus stations, etc. one could have a more incidental encounter with a machine without needing to be considered a gamer. As mobile gaming emerged, and duplicating many classic arcade games, there was even less incentive to

[Ninja Baseball Bat Man](https://youtu.be/JpBysvAbnbs) (1993)

## High Scores and competition

“The fact that players can enter their initials into a high score list creates a different kind of competition: you compete against previous players, whom you probably have never met. This competition is more indirect: you compare your score with their scores, and if you are one of the top eight players, you get to enter your initials into the game for other players to see, bumping off the player at the bottom of the list. However, you might later be bumped off as well. Here, your numeric score is translated into a scaled rank: either your score wasn't high enough to put you on the list, or you entered the list at a specific rank.”
## Continue…  

Prior to the continue, being able to play for a long time was a mark of skill. The high scores represented a single-quarter’s measure in both time and ability to score points. Once players could simply pay extra money to continue from where they had lost, high scores became more about how many quarters someone was willing to spend.

## Mail order games

In the UK, budget-friendly personal computers were popular enough to support independent game makes who distributed games on cheap cassette tape via the mail. 

The ZX Spectrum from 1981 for about $200 (~$688), while other personal computers were much more expensive (Commodore 64 - $595 / $1,551 or IBM PC 5150 $1565 / $4332)

# Cocktail Cabinet Input System

[Download Cocktail Input Asset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YVcr7K-cj00N_OxzMZAMPesqlxzEWfb2/view?usp=sharing) , also be sure to install the input system package for your 2D project. The template does not come with the input system package.  

NOTE: We are using Unity’s newer [Input System package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.5/manual/index.html) for this project (just like we did for roll-a-ball). So if you are trying to do Input.GetKeyDown("space") then you’re using the old system and the following info won’t work. If you want to use the older version, you’ll have to manually map the keys!

Currently the default input system uses “Actions” that are mapped to specific words like “Move” and “Fire”

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f8xJuRa9nvpC54V5K2NPGxz1TxUk8H-YAkjLRHEYNST2XmDnbexgbt51N9AejGe2-ii8HGAGDWnRxGi9oC95OqRxVsNeaAcICRed2Ovgjm2SECRNZk1RSdaEDMiBDzVUZe4m-lwEgCclm-_LtkQsYNI)

The cocktail cabinet input actions still use “Move” for the joysticks, but have more generic names for each of the six buttons.  

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0P4jZDjZYm39CJ3sO9HXHoS7NPWdBl7-Kc_APCi25yZe01VyoTDvCYD-uOXhU26GG4L2Ny8VpgADYbjIWQllLU_Kpz8AhS835d1SUxr02CxFEfrn3HQc9eGQQWuMd4jdD2nes7BsZCnUy-aYNyOgyiA)

## Adding the input actions

Download the unitypackage from the link above and import the unitypackage into your project.

After the import, you’ll see a new folder in your Project tab called “Inputs” which contains the GamelabCocktailCabinetControls input actions. You can double click it to see the mappings.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IugGlgxxDAr7q8V12Pj30ojNH3RpiFwxH7fABgZX1M1Vu6f49_QD9Um3mTzdShFkv6Df4DA1F6oCn6etLxpIPFNbPL5WSrFV5gMqlfD_WnFZZR_BwmlnRZpbnKoSMPjEWsMA6pEdAcXiEJb_duqUBcs)

Notice that there are also separate action maps for each player.

Next, attach a Player Input component to the object you want to control with your inputs. Then drag the GamelabCocktailCabinetControls into the Actions property.

When using the default Player Input component, the names of the actions are mapped to callback functions:

Move → OnMove
Fire → OnFire
Button1 → OnButton1

You can see a list of the callback functions at the bottom of the component:  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gIfeMxNrR0jPotrO5643U99AT47TZQ4XjYEvEnEU51sz-FvNTCxVhmk4O39cVcXkfBe1cVO5-WgtNT_Hoav6H4f94P2fQd0fWJGIDqkSsS4a1S16RkOwpdZ7xqYlWWLcuRRpTJuO2h8kxmS4416VYeQ)

With scripting, “Move” stays exactly the same between the two input action sets:

```csharp
void OnMove(InputValue moveValue)  
{  
	movement = moveValue.Get<Vector2>() * speed;  
}
```

You can also check what type of value the action will return to the InputValue variable in the Action Properties when selecting the specific action:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QmNjq7JeqOGAetylUGdhA2oFhclwwjg-2jCnaFMELDzTn3vnLHlL7OrP34POYiqVM6IPW2eK4wIDF9WEQ_bNovVtSbJsPI0jJCQJvZr0wAu7tF2N6pNOjt7nx80ZdwT7MQfe64TyBJwQCmiVlXbeh2M)  

For button types of actions like “Fire” and “Button1” there’s no need to pass a value into the function:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zZ8pzmbt83F1oI2F7nPIAi4gUS2PPq-3eS4WqHX7nbGRQ4AnEa-kTSEBptM7MFBQgxyEcrm4KmoOKx42VuP-bUT7Sn6Cg-QwXRaEw1Clx-t0SI4HGellnF-GTwY1TSgswMz0uRFnTGg5kyiOnT3IySQ)

```csharp
void OnFire()  
{  
	var obj = Instantiate(
		throwingPrefab, 
		throwingPoint.position, 
		throwingPoint.rotation);  
}
```

## Setting the player input for specific player inputs

In the player input component, you can modify which player is being controlled with the Default Map field  

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g64asx6kseFTeb5d8rA6wq_svFLPeAv6vRhfb1GwRQjGbvsLi-DqQtaIEG8AzOuV0SG5745Nuyik7UrfhXc5xZbsM2smbMFfbeAqKE9CKId9-iHylsDdjFsFvFuyASDJ2M2Dm-JBfPIZNwOi9CfbIL8)

## Modify existing functions

To use the Button1 inputs rather than something like Fire or Jump, you can change the name of the method in the script.

```csharp
void OnFire()  
{  
	var obj = Instantiate(
		throwingPrefab, 
		throwingPoint.position, 
		throwingPoint.rotation);  
}
```

Becomes

```csharp
void OnButton1()  
{  
	var obj = Instantiate(
		throwingPrefab, 
		throwingPoint.position, 
		throwingPoint.rotation);		  
}
```
  

Alternatively, you can rename the Actions in the Input Actions window

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/O4I3xuY4QTtgd55AS_U5_2OjwVB9A2NhL42SF45Wm9XPcaRVS_D4yzZ4xgxNmZnpQxCCXPAaZxbmpvWheY8HFWGdq-YzQDzmu55zlx4-JkedQAdjg8Iq0bWqR43F_9DfhEKCmOGuAxJBt6q49_12UTI)

## Testing script 

You can use this script test out the inputs. Here's an example of how to modify the basic movement script for the new input system:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;  
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;  

public class InputTesting : MonoBehaviour  
{
	public float speed = 10f;  													
	public Rigidbody2D rb;
	private Vector2 movement;  
	
	void FixedUpdate()
	{
		Vector2 newPosition = rb.position + movement * Time.fixedDeltaTime;  
		rb.MovePosition(newPosition);  
	} 

	void OnMove(InputValue moveValue)  
	{
		movement = moveValue.Get<Vector2>() * speed;  
	}

	void OnButton1() { print("button1"); }
	void OnButton2() { print("button2"); }
	void OnButton3() { print("button3"); }
	void OnButton4() { print("button4"); }
	void OnButton5() { print("button5"); }
	void OnButton6() { print("button6"); }
}
```

This is what the component setup would look like for one player:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/30y4oQCJ29eu2FloKPNqYrxoj5AmWNYKT4Q_goR6NJJ3PebnFuyuROdkR0ESWp6L-qADElBhMrB0G11IjihGeNXo3WFKPO66_LicmeutnJJGlUL6rpWXOmrcnU6aLRvleVq1TAWF9k4SEhl2n_fRg4I)

Try duplicating the object and setting the map to Player2.
# Vector Talk

Let’s talk a bit more about vectors and ways to get information about your game using vectors.

## Magnitude 

… is the length of the vector

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7hX82MkM_bWGy2nxLChrY1NbkU6Ja239dmU41_U2wl3GI36cEG83amz8LLg3AWlIe_ZGHKU21731pQ8zYSZQoy4C1ZA66A03yYqvuN6aodVwp17ZixUjHQ7aGniCxnXW6NSKu0ZDvomeA32rPGQYZGA)

You can get the magnitude of a vector in Unity like this:

```csharp
Vector3 myVector = new Vector3(2.5f, -4f, 6f);  
float mag = myVector.magnitude;
```
## Distance

Calculating the direction and distance between two points can be done with subtraction and taking the magnitude of the resulting vector.

  
```csharp
// Gets a vector that points from the player's position to the target's.
// Both variables are Transforms, so access the position property to
// get the vector.  
Vector3 heading = target.position - player.position;  
// get the length of the vector (distance between the two points) 
float distance = heading.magnitude;  
// Vector3 also has a distance method 
float distance2 = Vector3.Distance(target.position, player.position);
```

## Normalize a vector 

To normalize a vector is to keep the same heading, but with a magnitude scaled to one (often called a unit vector). Useful when you want to re-scale or limit the length of a vector but maintain its direction.

Here’s an example where the velocity of a rigidbody (rb) is modified:

```csharp
// get velocity and normalize
Vector3 myVelocity = rb.velocity;
Vector3 normalizedVelocity = myVelocity.normalized;  
// set a new velocity with scalar multiplication
float speed = 10f;
rb.velocity = speed * normalizedVelocity;
```
## Reflecting a vector

I mentioned reflection in class today. Here’s an example of how you can use Vector2.Reflect to change the velocity of a rigidbody when it collides with something:

```csharp
// changing the velocity by using reflection
private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
{        
// get the normal vector        
Vector2 normal = collision.contacts[0].normal;        
// create the reflection        
Vector2 newVelocity = Vector2.Reflect(rb.velocity, normal);        
// set the new velocity        
rb.velocity = newVelocity;
}
```

You could use this to make a custom screensaver:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rvTGPibz4r10UnZk5VUjpPKAuG19JfeIg4TiFqP467ISHwQYXE10ItS8mTFkaltZNblUUtbX84t4ZYvChLogHO8ialtzXRTMkoojWV8Q4vlja2VHwlFgiPVbcMQnU0aXAAR2UydqLFDdGv0dYAofZ90)

# Instantiate and Destroy

While the game is in play mode you can create game objects in the scene using the [Instantiate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html) method. If you want to fully remove a game object from the scene, use the [Destroy](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html) method.

```csharp
// a few ways of instantiating a prefab  
Instantiate(prefab);  
Instantiate(prefab, position, rotation);  
Instantiate(prefab, position, rotation, parent);  
// instantiate returns the newly created object  
GameObject newObject = Instantiate(prefab);
```

To instantiate an object, you first need to create a Prefab of that object:
## Design a prefab

1. Create a 2D circle in the scene Hierarchy. Create > 2D Object > Sprites > Circle.
2. Resize it using the Rect Tool and change the color in the Sprite Renderer.
3. Add a Rigidbody 2D. Leave the gravity scale at 1. Change Collision Detection to “Continuous”. (this isn’t totally necessary, but should be used for high speed objects)
4. Add a Circle Collider 2D.
5. Create a new folder in the Project tab called “Prefabs”.
6. Select the GameObject in the Hierarchy and drag it into the Prefabs folder in the Project tab. You’ll notice that the icon next to the game object becomes solid blue to indicate that it’s a prefab.

Note: You can click the arrow to the right of the prefab in the Hierarchy to enter prefab editing mode in the Scene view. Double-clicking on the prefab in the Project folder will also open the prefab editor. Editing the prefab here will change all instances of the prefab. The Hierarchy will change to reflect the structure of the prefab which can contain multiple child objects. Clicking on the left arrow takes you back to the normal Scene view.

7. Delete the Projectile from the Hierarchy.
## Build the spawner

8. Add an empty Game Object to the scene. Name it “Spawner”.
9. Add a Player Input component to the spawner game object and drag the GamelabCocktailCabinetControls into the Actions property.
10. Create a new script called “SpawnObject”
11. Open the script and add this code:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;  
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;  

public class SpawnObject : MonoBehaviour  
{  
	public GameObject prefab;  
	// Spawn every time Button1 is pressed    
	void OnButton1() {        
		Instantiate(prefab, transform.position, transform.rotation);    
	}
}
```

12. Save it and return to the editor.
13. Drag the prefab from before into the Prefab property of the script.

Press play and try spawning some objects. Notice that new objects are added to the hierarchy with “(clone)” added to the end of the name. Even though the objects fall off the bottom of the screen, they still exist in the scene. Let’s get rid of the objects.

The script uses the position of the GameObject as the position where the object will be instantiated (as well as the rotation). If you don’t add a position and rotation, Instantiate will use the transform values stored in the prefab.
## Destroy the objects

14. Open the prefab editor by double clicking on the prefab in the Project tab.
15. Add a new script to the prefab. Call it “DestroyObject”. Add this code to the script. Save the script.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;  

public class DestroyObject : MonoBehaviour  
{  
	public float delayTime = 1f;  
	void Start()  
	{  
		// destroy after a delay        
		Destroy(gameObject, delayTime);    
	}
}
```


Destroy allows you to add a delay before the object is removed. Press play and spawn objects, then keep an eye on the hierarchy and notice the objects disappearing.
## Build a playfield

Try creating a small level for the spawned objects to fall through. Consider classic pinball and pachinko machines. Use basic 2D sprites and colliders.

Also lots of examples on the [Internet Pinball Database](https://www.ipdb.org/search.pl)

Extra things to try:

1. Spawning objects and adding forces to them 

Hint: 

```csharp
var obj = Instantiate(prefab, transform.position, transform.rotation);
obj.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().AddForce(Vector2.up * 5);
```

```csharp
using UnityEngine;  
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;  

public class SpawnObject : MonoBehaviour  
{  
	public GameObject prefab;  
	// Spawn every time Button1 is pressed  
	void OnButton1()  
	{  
		GameObject obj = Instantiate(prefab, transform.position, transform.rotation); 
		obj.GetComponent<DestroyObject>().delayTime = Random.Range(0.5f, 5);  
		Rigidbody2D rb2d = obj.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();  
		rb2d.AddForce(new Vector2(1,1) * 5f, ForceMode2D.Impulse);  
	}  
}
```

2. Bumpers (i.e. add force to the object when it collides with specific objects)
3. Multiple spawn points that use different inputs to spawn
4. Points
