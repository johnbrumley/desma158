# Spatial Narrative

Short review of some concepts from [Jenkin’s “Game Design as Narrative Architecture”](https://web.mit.edu/~21fms/People/henry3/games&narrative.html)

1. **Evocative Spaces** – spaces may be designed to create a certain mood or atmosphere, or to convey a sense of place or history. (Dear Esther, Firewatch )

2. **Enacted Stories** – scripted events and set pieces to create a narrative experience within the game world. (Uncharted, The Last of Us, Metal Gear Solid)

3. **Embedded Narratives** – environmental storytelling to convey a game's backstory or lore. (Myst, Bioshock, Gone Home)

4. **Emergent Narratives** – narratives are not predetermined, but instead emerge from the player's choices and interactions with the game environment. (Minecraft, The Sims)

These categories are not exclusive to one another and many games contain some combination.


> In the case of evoked narratives, spatial design can either enhance our sense of immersion within a familiar world or communicate a fresh perspective on that story through the altering of established details. In the case of enacted narratives, the story itself may be structured around the character's movement through space and the features of the environment may retard or accelerate that plot trajectory. In the case of embedded narratives, the game space becomes a memory palace whose contents must be deciphered as the player tries to reconstruct the plot and in the case of emergent narratives, game spaces are designed to be rich with narrative potential, enabling the story-constructing activity of players.

# Thinking about visual expression, elements of design in games

Take each of these into consideration when designing the visual features of your project. How are you approaching a particular element? What does it communicate? How does one element relate to other visual, mechanical, textual, sonic, etc. elements of the work?

It can be useful to look online (or use a virtual assistant) on how to achieve the "look" from an existing game in Unity. Try including the term "shader" or "material", e.g.  "zelda shader in Unity"
# Line

For a ton of insightful opinions and examples – references within and beyond games – definitely check out this blog post on [Real Time 3D Imagery](https://startingoverinraccooncity.blogspot.com/2021/02/preferences-and-proposals-for-real-time.html)  

# Materials

So you may have an idea of how you would like things to look, but how do you design visual elements within Unity?

[URP Lighting and Materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjCCffMNw-B9tR5LMDwtBYbts4SaDhWpXhwk0I_bflE/edit?usp=sharing) : Looking at Lighting and Materials/Shaders in URP. This document is more for your own reference, but we’ll take a quick look.

## Exercise

Using found models (the [Everything Library](https://www.davidoreilly.com/library) is a good starting place), create a still life using lights, materials, textures, and skyboxes as described in [URP Lighting and Materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjCCffMNw-B9tR5LMDwtBYbts4SaDhWpXhwk0I_bflE/edit?usp=sharing). 

Alternatively, you can focus on building out the space and atmosphere of your Project 1 scene using lights, materials, textures, and skyboxes.

# Triggers, Collisions, and Events

TODO: add in collider scene. to talk about these

TODO: maybe mod the collider scene with events if not already there?

# Some helper scripts and prefab



talk about the helper scripts and how to use them? Maybe intro importing / exporting unitypackages and create a small challenge for people to solve?
