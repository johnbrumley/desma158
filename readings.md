# Reading 1

For the first reading, we will have two groups:

Group 1 will read Henry Jenkins' [_Game Design as Narrative Architecture_](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc1ZLvixfA21bt_kRndowxsdlBaY-MnXRQyjz5l445WW4OCIg/viewform?usp=sf_link) 

Group 2 will read Alenda Y. Chang's [_Rambunctious Games: A Manifesto for Environmental Game Design_](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwgTGhoZcYTPWxaqenQXgsB6i__YpqTOidfp-dTJ3Rk9Jrvg/viewform?usp=sf_link) 

You'll be in Group 1 if the first number of your student ID is even, and Group 2 if it is odd.

Click the links to find a form with a link to the reading. Take a look at the questions and keep them in mind while reading. You don't need to write long responses to the answers, use them like short notes that you can reference when we talk about them on Tuesday.
