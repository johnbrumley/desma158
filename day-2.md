# Project 1

In the not so distant future, Project 1 will be due.¬†

So let‚Äôs chat about Roll-a-ball.

[Project 1 Info](project-1.md)¬†

Thoughts on Roll-a-ball, was it a nice tour of Unity?¬†

We‚Äôll eventually cover everything again, but are there any burning questions that you‚Äôre curious about now?

## Parts of Unity that Roll-a-ball covers
Lighting and Materials, Rigidbody Component / Physics, Vectors, Colliders / Triggers, UI / TextMeshPro, Input System, Prefabs

While the tutorial only introduces each one, we'll eventually spend more time covering each one in depth.

# How can we enhance this game?

Think about all the different components of the demo ‚Ä¶ try and make a sentence that encapsulates the game

# A ball that rolls around in a level and collects items.

  
Which words could you swap, remove, add to the phrase to make it more interesting?¬†

What is the major challenge of roll-a-ball?¬†

Is winning too easy? What about losing? (does either need to exist? For project 1: yes)

# Variations of Roll-a-ball

There are lots of games that are more-or-less fancy variations of roll-a-ball, for example this game: 

## A (noun) that (verbs) around a (noun) and (verbs) (nouns) 

How about: 
"A boat in the ocean finding messages"

# Building your level

After creating your own modified roll-a-ball sentence, you'll need a place for it to occur. 

Defined by [The Level Design Book](https://book.leveldesignbook.com/introduction) (mostly a plug for checking out this book!)

> A level is a space where a game happens.

But the biggest question you'll need to answer before starting level layout:
## What is your level trying to accomplish?

- Are you teaching the player a new mechanic?
- Are you telling a story?
- Are you making a space to hang out and relax?

Think through what you're trying to do and jot down what a player should experience over the course of the level and what should they take away at the end?

# Parti

If you like, you could borrow an architectural term *parti* meaning the central concept or organizing principle of a structure. 

- Sometimes the parti can be in the form of a statement, but often is tied directly to a diagram. 

- The parti can be wholly inclusive, informing all aspects of a structure from exterior and configuration down to fixtures and tile patterns. 

- Not only limited to formal aspects, parti can describe massing, zoning, community, and other concerns.

# Level Layout

After you've nailed down what your goals and concepts for your level. you can begin sketching or laying out ideas. 

![](Pasted%20image%2020230930222757.png)
_Super Mario Bros._¬†(1985) planning sheet (Source:¬†[Nintendo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLoRd6_a1CI))

If you need to communicate your level to others in a team, you'll need to be more detailed and clear about your level. If it's just you, then your layout can be a sketch, scribble, or anything that will aid in planning the space.

# Environmental + Expressivity

Or ‚Ä¶ level design. When thinking about a player's movement through your level, at both micro and macro scales, there are features to consider about the environment that can exist from intrinsic to the concept of the game to helping a player know where to go next.

*[A short hike](https://ashorthike.com/) (2019) - Adam Robinson-yu*

These are just a few strategies identified by Paolo Pedercini [here (currently broken ü¶ó )](http://mycours.es/gamestudio2022/a-pattern-language-for-expressive-environments/) (with a lot of example games to check out)

## **Choice**
which path to take? Is there a point where you can‚Äôt go back? [Point of](https://youtu.be/2v8YragSIuI) [no return](https://youtu.be/yavaJNXoMe8).

![](Pasted%20image%2020231001120351.png)

## **Legibility** (affordances of the space) - how does the player understand what they can do in the world. A ladder implies climbing. A door might indicate another space or goal.

**Signposting** - ‚Äúsee that mountain‚Ä¶‚Äù, showing where to go with a big landmark (see [weenies](https://theoryofthemeparks.blogspot.com/2015/08/wayfinding-in-themed-design-weenie.html)) - another method can be leading using lighting (tendency to avoid darkness, trying to find a light)

**A Trail** - a literal pathway or breadcrumbs that a player can choose to follow

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XeCGx2UOymmjLCvyTb446ZaX2zT9-gSJxO7YzIj7j4T-I3QZ1qLS3dzDZyiHpVwKi2wXms8jmJ8kUCEGI9vC6MZMM02w1x8ryI6-kIhtkhFxKeKzjFBvQZCTqZ67OCv4Z8DiHEjH4VOMVBdqp8HH4ec)*[Katamari Damacy](https://youtu.be/bKl-PMCNuCY) (2004)*

**Progression of different space** - unlocking new areas, moving from small tunnels to open fields, different types of rooms (or a series of the same room)

[One button Nipple Golf](https://jrap.itch.io/obng)¬† ‚Äì the level reveals itself through each action

**Vistas** - observation points let a player set new goals, see how far they‚Äôve come, take a break, foreshadow the next challenge

![](Pasted%20image%2020230918182728.png)
**Denial and reward** - Add weight to a reveal, induce momentary "lostness" 

**Easter eggs** - hidden objects, images, and notes elicit close focus on the environment¬†

*[Hidden Folks](https://hiddenfolks.com/) (2017)*

*54:19 - Opening section* - how many of the above techniques can you spot?

# Spatial Memory

Levels of games, virtual environments, can become part of our spatial memories.

More abstractly, we all have a sense of spatial memory relating to software that isn‚Äôt necessarily meant for gaming.

# Can anyone name this map?¬†

# Exercise

Let's try creating some maps by hand. 

Consider a setting/activity/goal/history/idea and the tools of environmental expression we just discussed.

In addition to the form of the map, include any other things that might live there: objects, plants, creatures, buildings, cities, planets, etc.

This doesn't have to be the world you use in Project 1, but if you already have an idea feel free to work on that. 
## Ideas, inspirations
- Go to [https://noclip.website/](https://noclip.website/) and explore some digital versions of maps
- Check out the [Videogame Atlas](https://www.youandpea.com/atlas) for different geographies of game levels
- Try and re-imagine a familiar building or space, but distort the proportions and distances to represent other tangible/intangible aspects (temp, time spent, feeling, safety)
- Draw a map from memory of something you do every day on the computer / phone / internet ‚Ä¶¬†how could you represent a non-spatial thing as a place to be navigated through?

> "During the eight years Pnin had taught at Waindell College he had changed his lodgings... about every semester. The accumulation of consecutive rooms in his memory now resembled those displays of grouped elbow chairs on show, and beds, and lamps, and inglenooks which, ignoring all space-time distinctions, commingle in the soft light of a furniture store beyond which it snows, and the dusk deepens, and nobody really loves anybody."

# Back to Roll-a-ball

Given all of these possibilities for navigating the space, what are some ways to spruce up Roll-a-ball?

Lose Conditions / Challenges / Situations:

1. ‚Ä¶
2. ‚Ä¶   
3. ‚Ä¶  

Changing the field of play, the level, the space:

1. Holes in the field (see [donut county](http://www.donutcounty.com/))
2. ...   
# Beyond the demo

Consider the definitions and expectations of the roll-a-ball demo. 

What assumptions is Unity making about it's userbase and the engine itself? 

What are some critiques of this demo? 
# Roll-a-ball as a platform 

Consider the basic components that define the base game? 

- Rolling
- Platform with walls
- Collecting
- Winning

How can you complicate these components? Does changing/removing/amplifying/negating any of these make for something more interesting?  

Maybe the result isn't a ‚Äúgood‚Äù game, but it becomes interesting, unexpected, outrageous‚Ä¶¬†

# Some extra tips

Align to view: Ctrl + shift + F

Useful for quickly setting up camera shots.¬†

1. Select a GameObject (usually the Camera)¬†
2. Move your scene view to where you want it
3. Use the key shortcut or use Game Object > Align With View

**Snap Object to Surface**: Hold Ctrl + shift while dragging the center of the object
