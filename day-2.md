# Day 2

Week 1, Tuesday

# Project 1

In the not so distant future, Project 1 will be due. 

So let’s chat about Roll-a-ball.

[Project 1 Info](project-1.md) 

Thoughts on Roll-a-ball, was it a nice tour of Unity? 

We’ll eventually cover everything again, but are there any burning questions that you’re curious about now?

# Some topics that were covered that we will get to soon:

Lighting and Materials, Rigidbody Component / Physics, Vectors, Colliders / Triggers, UI / TextMeshPro, Input System, Prefabs

# How can we enhance this game?

Think about all the different components of the demo … try and make a sentence that encapsulates the game

# A ball that rolls around in a level and collects items.

  
Which words could you swap, remove, add to the phrase to make it more interesting? 

What is the major challenge of roll-a-ball? 

Is winning too easy? What about losing? (does either need to exist? For project 1: yes)

# Variations of Roll-a-ball

There are lots of games that are more-or-less fancy variations of roll-a-ball, for example this game: 

## A (noun) that (verbs) around a (noun) and (verbs) (nouns) 

How about a boat in the ocean finding messages:

# Environmental + Expressivity

Or … level design

These are just a few strategies identified by Paolo Pedercini [here](http://mycours.es/gamestudio2022/a-pattern-language-for-expressive-environments/) (with a lot of example games to check out)

**Choice** - which path to take? Is there a point where you can’t go back? [Point of](https://youtu.be/2v8YragSIuI) [no return](https://youtu.be/yavaJNXoMe8).

**Legibility** (affordances of the space) - how does the player understand what they can do in the world. A ladder implies climbing. A door might indicate another space or goal.

**Signposting** - “see that mountain…”, showing where to go with a big landmark (see [weenies](https://theoryofthemeparks.blogspot.com/2015/08/wayfinding-in-themed-design-weenie.html)) - another method can be leading using lighting (tendency to avoid darkness, trying to find a light)

**A Trail** - a literal pathway or breadcrumbs that a player can choose to follow

**Progression of different space** - unlocking new areas, moving from small tunnels to open fields, different types of rooms (or a series of the same room)

[One button Nipple Golf](https://jrap.itch.io/obng)  – the level reveals itself through each action

**Vistas** - observation points let a player set new goals, see how far they’ve come, take a break, foreshadow the next challenge

# Spatial Memory

Levels of games, virtual environments, can become part of our spatial memories.

More abstractly, we all have a sense of spatial memory relating to software that isn’t necessarily meant for gaming.

Draw a virtual map from memory of something you do every day on the computer / phone / internet …

# Back to Roll-a-ball

Given all of these possibilities for navigating the space, what are some ways to spruce up Roll-a-ball?


Lose Conditions:

1. …
    
2. …
    
3. …
    

Changing the field of play, the level, the space:

1. Holes in the field (see [donut county](http://www.donutcounty.com/))
    
2. …
      
# Beyond the demo
Consider the definitions and expectations of the roll-a-ball demo. 

Can you complicate them? 
What are the most basic components that define the base game? 
Does changing/removing/amplifying/negating any of those components make it more interesting? 

Maybe the result isn't a “good” game, but it becomes interesting, unexpected, outrageous…

# Some extra tips

Align to view: Ctrl + shift + F

Useful for quickly setting up camera shots. 

1. Select a GameObject (usually the Camera) 
2. Move your scene view to where you want it
3. Use the key shortcut or use Game Object > Align With View

**Snap Object to Surface**: Hold Ctrl + shift while dragging the center of the object

# C# From the basics

See this [Brackeys playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4CtEelGPsmPzlvP7ISPYzR) for a tutorial on just C# without any Unity (though it’s part of a Unity channel) 

Also useful to know that if you’re trying to search for help with C#, you can also search for “csharp” to get more results
## Default template

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyEmptyScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
```

MyEmptyScript.cs - C# files end with “.cs”

# Classes 

Names and File names / Uniqueness / Namespaces

When you create a new C# script it automatically creates a new class with the same name as the script. It’s important to make sure that the filename and the class name are always the same. If you are copying and pasting code, you might accidentally change your class name and suddenly get a bunch of errors in the console.

In a Unity project every class name must be unique. There can never be more than one class with the same name. If you see errors like:  

```The namespace '<global namespace>' already contains a definition for 'PlayerController'```

Then you’ll need to go in and find the other class that’s also named “PlayerController”

# Namespaces

Namespaces are like containers which assist in organizing classes and avoiding duplicate naming errors. 

At the top of the default script you’re including a few namespaces with the “using” keyword in order to use the classes contained within them. In particular, the UnityEngine namespace allows you to use all of the classes contained within it.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vPzRgHSG2GXDDsu9muqATRA0J-eVagcuBnV15TAR4eTSwh2oygctJfsBO63IokSOkt2EQzx1-tqRGoDFKfMUVeB8lw3dkY4O16XDUGnOVmooYDa5VuzwbyuwMcOxzd7rV9FhhWTHganp_GF9WTAI2kM)

[https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) 

This also helps to reduce typing. Otherwise you would have to reference the namespace and then the class (e.g. UnityEngine.GameObject vs GameObject)

You can define your own namespaces by wrapping your classes with the keyword ‘namespace’ and the name of your namespace.

```csharp
namespace MyNamespace 
{
	class MyClass 
      {
          ...
      }
}
```

Likely, you won’t need to make a custom namespace for this class, but it’s pretty useful when collaborating with other people or creating your own plugins to share.
# Variables

A variable stores some information and the type of the variable specifies what sort of information it can store.

The main types of variables in C# are:

- Int - whole numbers: -1, -4, 0, 199
- Float - decimals up to 8 digits: 3.14159
- String - store text: “this is a string”
- Bool - true or false

Variables are declared using this structure:

```Type Name = Value;```

For example:

```csharp
int myInteger = 6;
float myFloat = -5.4f;
string myString = "hi there";
```

The naming convention for variables is to start with a non-capital letter with the first letter of each subsequent word capitalized.

```csharp
// declare a variable without assigning a value
bool myBool;
```

You also probably noticed that some variables are also marked as public or private. When a variable is marked as public, it becomes accessible to other classes. Marking a variable as public is also a way to have it show up in the Inspector.

```cs
public float speed = 0f;
private int count = 0;
```

The ‘f’ after a float makes sure that the variable is a float rather than a double.

When using the UnityEngine namespace, there are a lot of classes that can also be declared like variables

```cs
Transform myTransform;
Vector3 myPosition;
Rigidbody rb;
```
# Conditionals

Conditionals work in C# in nearly the same way as Processing and p5.js

```cs
if(numberOfEggs < 10)
{
   print("adding eggs");
} else if(numberOfEggs == 10)
{
   print("just enough eggs");
} else
{
   print("too many eggs");
}
```

You can also create compound statements with logical operators

**! - not
&& - and 
|| - or**

```cs
bool notscrambled = true;
if (notscrambled && numberOfEggs > 0)
{
    // call scramble egg function
    ScrambleEggs();
}
```

# Collections

Collections store groups of variables 
## Arrays

Arrays contain a fixed number of items and are declared with:

```cs
// fill an array with values directly
type[] nameOfArray = {value, value2, value3 };

// create an empty array to fill in later (maybe with a loop)
type[] nameOfArray = new type[50];  
```

To access a member of the array you can reference it by its index, with the first index beginning at zero and the last index at one less than the length of the array.

```cs
int[] myNumbers = { -1, 2, 6, 0, 6 };
print(myNumbers[3]); // prints 0
```
## Lists

If you don’t know how many values you’ll need, then a list is useful as it can vary in length.

To use a list, make sure you’re including the *System.Collections.Generic* namespace


```cs
// declare a list
List<type> myList = new List<type>();
// add something to the list
myList.Add(value);
```


```cs
// declare a list
List<string> niceWords = new List<string>();
// add something to the list
niceWords.Add("Nice!");
// get the number of items in the list
niceWords.Count
```

# Loops 

Repeating sections of code.

For loop in C#:

```cs
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    print(i);
}
```

This will loop until a conditional is met. In the above case, the variable ‘i’ will increment by one each loop until it is no longer less than 10.

Loops are great for working with collections:

```cs
float[] lotsOfFloats = new float[1200];
// fill the array with fives
for (int i = 0; i < lotsOfFloats.Length; i++)
{
    lotsOfFloats[i] = 5f;
}
```

When you want to iterate over an entire collection, use a foreach loop:

```cs
// calculate the average value
float total = 0;
foreach(float myFloat in lotsOfFloats)
{
    total += myFloat;
}
float average = total / lotsOfFloats.Length;
```

While loop in C#:
```cs
// infinite loop
while (true)
{

}
```
  
The loop will continue until the conditional statement becomes false.

```cs
//check if button is still pressed before each iteration
while (buttonIsPressed)
{
    buttonIsPressed = IsButtonPressed();
}
```

A bit less common is the Do loop, which evaluates the Boolean expression at the end of each iteration:

```cs
do
{
	buttonIsPressed = IsButtonPressed();
	// check if the button is pressed at the end of each iteration
} while (buttonIsPressed);
```
