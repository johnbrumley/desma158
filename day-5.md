# Project 1: Ball Game Showcase 

## Share, Play, Crit

We’ll be playing each other’s projects in groups in a round-robin format.

# Here are the rules:

1. One person in the group becomes a presenter. This person stays at the group's "home base."  
2. The rest of the group plays and gives feedback. (The presenter should ***not*** play their own project)
3. After 5 minutes, the players move to the next group. The presenter stays at home.
4. Repeat Step 3 until the players are back home.
5. A new group member becomes the presenter and the process restarts.

# For Presenters:
- Don't play your own project! 
- Allow players to get stuck or try to figure things out on their own.
- Take note of player reactions. What confuses them? What do they enjoy?
# For Players

If you're excited about something, share it! Think about your experience while playing and if it fits with the intention of the project. 

If you're unsure about what to focus on. Here are a bunch of questions you could ask yourself as you play: 

Connection to Roll-a-ball: 
- How does the project enhance the roll-a-ball demo?
- What is the type of enhancement? Win/Lose condition? Story? Subversion?

Player Experience:
- Was the objective clear? Did the rules and mechanics feel connected to this? 
- Was it easy to learn?
- Was there a narrative arc or difficulty curve? Would play again?

Style / Design
- What are the aesthetic qualities? Does it support the theme? How is the world constructed to emphasize theme?
- Opportunities for strategy and decision-making? Did choices feel meaningful? Was planning required?
- Were there any loopholes or exploits that players could take advantage of? Was this intended?
