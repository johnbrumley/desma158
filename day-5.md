# Project 1: Ball Game Showcase 

Share, Play, Crit

We’ll be playing each other’s projects in groups in a round-robin format. I’ll use this sheet to randomize group placement:

# Here are the rules:

1. The first student of each group will present their game at their group’s ”play station”.  
2. The rest of the group will playtest and give feedback for 6 minutes.
3. With the presenting students staying in place, the rest of the group will rotate to the next play station and have another 6 minute playtest. 
4. This repeats until everyone has returned to their original station.
5. Then the second student of each group will set up their game, and the entire process will repeat.

# While not playing the games, take notes and provide feedback. Here are some questions to consider:
- How does the game innovate on the roll-a-ball demo? Winning / losing mechanic? Story? Subversion? 
- Was the objective of the game clear? Did the rules and mechanics support the objective?
- Was the game easy to learn and understand? Were the instructions clear and concise?
- Was the game challenging and engaging? Did it hold your interest? Was there a narrative arc or difficulty curve?
- Were there any loopholes or exploits that players could take advantage of?
- What are the aesthetic qualities of the game? Did they support the thematic aspects of the game? How is the world / level constructed to emphasize the purpose of the game?
- Did the game provide opportunities for strategy and decision-making? Were players able to make meaningful choices and plan ahead?
- Improvements to the game? Are there any changes or additions that could make it more fun, engaging, balanced, weird?
