# Let's Play Project 2 Games

We're going to try out a different format for playtesting Project 2. 

## Setup and Format
- Split into two groups: 1 & 2 (I'll count it out). 
- Pair up with someone in the other group.
- Play each other's games, then ask questions, give comments. (10 minutes).
- Group 2 will stay put and group 1 will shift to over to pair with the next group 2 member.

## Things to consider

- Allow the other person to play the game without giving any introduction or instructions. Useful for highlighting unclear instructions/controls and possible content or conceptual misreads.
- What parts do players respond to? Which parts of the game did you spend the most time working on? Does the game feel zine-like in any of the ways we've discussed in class?
- How do the mechanics (interaction, loop, challenges, etc.) align with the concepts, themes, and ideas within the game?
- Does the game allow for player expression? Do players feel agency while playing, or is the game meant to be a linear experience?
- What are ways to improve, balance, expand? Is there one aspect that feels very rich, but underutilized?
