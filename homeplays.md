# Homeplay 1: Spatial Narrative and Environment

Since Project 1 involves expanding on the world of roll-a-ball, we've compiled games that take different approaches to player movement, time, and level design. When playing these games consider the decisions made by the developers, the intentional use of friction, and if the concept and narrative of the game aligns with the mechanics of the game.

# How to access games

## PC Games

PC game files are available on the computer in the "undergrad lounge" on the fourth floor (Turn right after exiting the elevators). 

After logging into the computer, they can be found in the folder "C:\\Desma158\\homeplay1". You can play the games directly on the PC or put them on your own computer. If your game is available for mac and need the file, let us know.

This is the room where you can find the computer:

## Console Games

For games that require a console (highlighted in magenta on the sheet), you can go to the print lab desk and let the attendant know that you want to check out a game for DESMA 158. 

**You will need your student ID** to check out the game+console. You can only set up the console and play the game on one of the screens in the undergrad lounge (see above photos). 

If there isn't a person at the desk, you can check if someone is in the office across from the desk.
