# [Bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/) Microjam

For this tiny game jam, we will use a "tiny" game engine ... [Bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/) 

This engine was made by Adam Le Doux who writes:

> hi! bitsy is a little editor for little games or worlds. the goal is to make it easy to make games where you can walk around and talk to people and be somewhere.

# Theme

The theme for the jam is ***combinations*** 

Generate your bitsy game ideas with an open prompt that allows you to create new story combinations between different things. 

Here it is:

> a (noun) is wandering in (a place). upon arriving at / encountering (a specific location / object / person in the place), a story about (a topic) unfolds.

We'll return to this in a moment. But first how do you do things in bitsy?

# Brainstorming

You've gotten a quick taste of the engine, so let's come up with some ideas!

1. Grab a paper
2. Write a version of this sentence with the parenthesis filled in with your own ideas:
   > a (noun) is wandering in (a place). upon (arriving at / encountering) (a specific location / object / person in the place), a story about (a topic) unfolds.
3. When you're done. Put your paper on the designated idea table.
